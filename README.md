# Arduino-Powered_IOT_Based_Poultry-Fish_Farm

This repository contains the code and documentation for an innovative IoT-based farming system developed during my Bachelor's third year. Our project, "Arduino-Powered_IOT_Based_Poultry&Fish_Farm," leverages Arduino and IoT technologies to create a smart and automated farming solution for poultry and fish.

Key Features:
•	Real-time monitoring of environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, water quality).
•	Automated feeding and watering systems for poultry.
•	Smart fish tank management and feeding automation.
•	Data logging and remote access through IoT connectivity.
